          <h2>Welcome to the new AAF Virtual Home</h2>
          <p>Over the past few months we've been hard at work on this new version of the AAF Virtual Home.</p>
          <p> The new version will enable small organisations, including collaborative research facilities, to manage user identities for international, government and industry based researchers.</p>

          <p>Users are provided with:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A view of account details to assist with maintenance of your personal information;</li>
            <li>Secure management of passwords;</li>
            <li>The ability to reset a forgotten password 24/7 with our simple online tools; and</li>
            <li>Support for multiple browsers and mobile devices to assist you logging in wherever you are.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Administrators are provided with:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>An easier to use and navigate administrative interface;</li>
            <li>Per organisation and per group scopes for authentication assertions;
            <li>Better security for your users. Password resets use one time codes instead of having you set something on their behalf; and</li>
            <li>The ability to manage many more groups and users than was previously possible.</li>
          </ul>
